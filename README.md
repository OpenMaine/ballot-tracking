Investigating how Maine's absentee ballot tracking system currently works, and could be expanded.

## Background

Increased interest in absentee balloting this year, due especially to the Covid pandemic, comes at the same time as concerns about decreased efficiency of the United States Postal Service. Many people are asking whether they can trust mailing in their absentee ballots. In response to the expansion of absentee balloting in Maine, the Maine Secretary of State's office announced on 9/28/2020 that such a tracking system is now available.
