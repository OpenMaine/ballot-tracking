Investigating how Maine's absentee ballot tracking system currently works, and could be expanded.

## Background

Increased interest in absentee balloting this year, due especially to the Covid pandemic, comes at the same time as concerns about decreased efficiency of the United States Postal Service. Many people are asking whether they can trust mailing in their absentee ballots.

We know that some states utilize mail-in balloting much on a much larger scale than Maine, or even exclusively. A common feature of their systems is to offer a ballot tracking system so that voters can track the progress of their mail-in ballot online. Maine lacks a comprehensive centralized system for this. While offering ballot dropboxes as an alternative to the postal service appears to be on the increase among Maine towns, we can assume that mailing in their ballot will still be the most convenient option for many people, especially those with mobility challenges. If people knew that they would be able to confirm that their ballot was received, it would increase their confidence in the system, and perhaps their likelihood to vote at all.

Given the short timeline to November, this project will at present consist mostly of research, and ideally, some kind of prototype, perhaps with a few select municipalities.
